# Lesson 1 homework - Level 1

You are in charge of maintaining an illegal arcade. You bought shoddy arcade machines off of Temu and they sadly came with missing information. You need to help put back the missing information to allow your shady customers to lose all their money at your store.

Create a float variable to make the default score 0.00 so the grimy kids don't win when gambling.


```python
%%js
// Would you use Let or Const?
let defaultScore = 0.00;

```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


Define a variable "playerLimit" that cannot be re-assigned and give it a value of 4. This will prevent the raggamuffins from ruining your game.


```python
%%js
const playerLimit = 4;

```

Create a string variable to store the players name. Those dirty children have to verify their victory somehow.


```python
%%js
let playerName = "Anonymous";

```

Make a boolean to set gameFunction to false.


```python
%%js
let gameFunction = false;

```

Now put it all together in this code cell to allow the children to gamble away all their parents money! The quick example may help you, it is for a superhero game the basement dwellers fixed.


```python
%%js
// 1. Hero Name (String)
let heroName = prompt("Your name here");

// 2. Points Scored (Number)
let points = 0.0;

// 3. Energy Levels (Number
let energyLevel = 100.0;

// 4. Mission Status (Boolean)
let missionComplete = false;

// Training Simulation
console.log(`Welcome, ${heroName}! Your training begins now.`);
console.log(`Starting energy level: ${energyLevel}`);
console.log(`Points: ${points}`);

// Task 1
energyLevel -= 5.5;
points += 10;
console.log("You completed a task!");
console.log(`Energy level: ${energyLevel}`);
console.log(`Points: ${points}`);

// Task 2
energyLevel -= 5.5;
points += 10;
console.log("You completed another task!");
console.log(`Energy level: ${energyLevel}`);
console.log(`Points: ${points}`);

// Completing the mission
missionComplete = true;
if (missionComplete) {
    console.log(`Mission Accomplished, ${heroName}!`);
    console.log(`Final score: ${points}`);
}
```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


Now, create something that on run, defines a playername, sets a game score, and decreases some amount from it. Make sure to use console.log to print the playername and the variable before and after the operation. Go forth, future basement dwellers.


```python
%%js
// Define a player name and initial score
let playerName = "Grimy Kid";
let gameScore = 100;

// Print the player name and initial score
console.log(`Player Name: ${playerName}`);
console.log(`Initial Score: ${gameScore}`);

// Decrease the score by a certain amount
let pointsLost = 20;
gameScore -= pointsLost;

// Print the updated score after the operation
console.log(`Player Name: ${playerName}`);
console.log(`Score after losing ${pointsLost} points: ${gameScore}`);

```

## Lesson 1 homework - Level 2

This homework is harder than the last, to make sure you are efficient workers in the basement. You will now create code for a space invaders knockoff since we obviously can't afford to get the actual one. 
- Complete the code and READ THE COMMENTS. Don't leave any underscores and make some working code!


```python
// Replace Blanks and fill in information with code

// Put variables for spaceship and mission below
let spaceship = "Red Falcon"; // Name your spaceship
let initialFuel = 100; // Initial fuel value
let distanceTraveled = 0; // Set distance traveled
let fuelConsumptionRate = 2; // Fuel decrease rate per distance

// 2. Mission variables assigning
let selectedFuel = 50; // Assign how much fuel is allocated for the mission
let missionStatus = ""; // Status of the mission
let fuelDrops = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1; 
// Random fuel drops (1 to 3)

// 3. Add random fuel during the mission
function collectFuel(currentFuel, distance) {
  let fuelCollected = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 10; // Random fuel between 10 and 30
  console.log(`At distance ${distance}, a fuel drop was found! Collected ${fuelCollected} fuel.`);
  return currentFuel + fuelCollected; // Add collected fuel
}

// 4. Mission logic
if (selectedFuel > initialFuel) {
  missionStatus = "Mission failed. Not enough fuel!";
} else if (selectedFuel <= 0) {
  missionStatus = "Mission aborted. Fuel must be greater than zero.";
} else {
  // Beginning mission
  for (let i = 0; i < fuelDrops; i++) {
    // Calculate distance and update remaining fuel
    distanceTraveled += selectedFuel / fuelConsumptionRate;
    initialFuel -= selectedFuel;

    // Check if thereâ€™s still enough fuel for the mission
    if (initialFuel <= 0) {
      missionStatus = `Mission failed! The spaceship ran out of fuel after traveling ${distanceTraveled} units.`;
      break;
    }

    // Collect random fuel
    initialFuel = collectFuel(initialFuel, distanceTraveled);
  }

  // Set end results of mission status
  if (initialFuel > 0) {
    missionStatus = `Mission successful! The spaceship ${spaceship} traveled ${distanceTraveled} units of distance. Remaining fuel: ${initialFuel}`;
  }
}

// 5. Output the mission results
console.log(`Spaceship: ${spaceship}`);
console.log(`Fuel given: ${selectedFuel}`);
console.log(`Distance traveled: ${distanceTraveled}`);
console.log(`Remaining fuel: ${initialFuel}`);
console.log(`Mission Status: ${missionStatus}`);

```

- For you cheating basement dwellers, look away and go complete your code for minimal to no pay. 
- But for those of you who completed it, here is something to check your code with. Also make sure to run your own code and see it in console to ensure the gambling children can play the games.


```python
%%js

let spaceship = "Mort's Flying Monkey";
let initialFuel = 100; 
let distanceTraveled = 0; 
let fuelConsumptionRate = 2; 

let selectedFuel = 50; 
let missionStatus = ""; 
let fuelDrops = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1; 


function collectFuel(currentFuel, distance) {
  let fuelCollected = Math.floor(Math.random() * 20) + 10; 
  console.log(`At distance ${distance}, a fuel drop was found! Collected ${fuelCollected} fuel.`);
  return currentFuel + fuelCollected;
}

if (selectedFuel > initialFuel) {
  missionStatus = "Mission failed. Not enough fuel!";
} else if (selectedFuel <= 0) {
  missionStatus = "Mission aborted. Fuel must be greater than zero.";
} else {

  for (let i = 0; i < fuelDrops; i++) {
   
    distanceTraveled += selectedFuel / fuelConsumptionRate;
    initialFuel -= selectedFuel;

    
    if (initialFuel <= 0) {
      missionStatus = `Mission failed! The spaceship ran out of fuel after traveling ${distanceTraveled} units.`;
      break;
    }

    
    initialFuel = collectFuel(initialFuel, distanceTraveled);
  }

  
  if (initialFuel > 0) {
    missionStatus = `Mission successful! The spaceship ${spaceship} traveled ${distanceTraveled} units of distance. Remaining fuel: ${initialFuel}`;
  }
}

console.log(`Spaceship: ${spaceship}`);
console.log(`Fuel given: ${selectedFuel}`);
console.log(`Distance traveled: ${distanceTraveled}`);
console.log(`Remaining fuel: ${initialFuel}`);
console.log(`Mission Status: ${missionStatus}`);
```

### Lesson 2: Level 1

You need to get the color of the cars from the frogger game. Use an instance variable called myCar to accomplish this. 


```python
class Car {
  constructor(color) {
    this.color = color;  // Instance variable
  }

  getColor() {
    return this.color; // Access the instance variable
  }
}

const myCar = new Car("red"); // Choose any color
console.log(myCar.getColor()); // Output: red

```

You need a static variable for player lives. Use the variable playerLives to set the number of lives to 3.


```python
class Health {
  static playerLives = 3;  // Static variable for player lives
}

console.log(Health.playerLives);  // Output: 3

```

### Lesson 2 - Level 2

Create a Book class with an instance variable title and a static variable bookCount that tracks how many books have been created. Add a method getBookInfo() to return the book's title and total number of books.


```python
class Book {
  static bookCount = 0;  // Static variable to track total books

  constructor(title) {
    this.title = title;  // Instance variable for title
    Book.bookCount++;  // Use the static variable and increment it
  }

  getBookInfo() {
    return `Book Title: ${this.title}, Total Books: ${Book.bookCount}`; // Use instance and static variables
  }
}

const book1 = new Book("Mort's Guide to Making Students Fear You");
const book2 = new Book("JavaScript Basics"); // Name a book for yourself
console.log(book1.getBookInfo()); // Output: Book Title: Mort's Guide to Making Students Fear You, Total Books: 2
console.log(book2.getBookInfo()); // Output: Book Title: JavaScript Basics, Total Books: 2

```


    <IPython.core.display.Javascript object>


Create an ArcadeGame class that:
- Has instance variables gameName and highScore.
- Has a static variable totalGames to track how many - arcade games have been created.
- Includes a method getGameInfo() to return the game name and high score.
- Includes a static method getTotalGames() to return the total number of arcade games created.


```python
class ArcadeGame {
  static totalGames = 0;  // Static variable to track total number of games

  constructor(gameName, highScore) {
    this.gameName = gameName;  // Instance variable for game name
    this.highScore = highScore;  // Instance variable for high score
    ArcadeGame.totalGames++;  // Increment static variable each time a new game is created
  }

  // Instance method to return the game name and high score
  getGameInfo() {
    return `${this.gameName}: High Score = ${this.highScore}`;  // Return game info
  }

  // Static method to get the total number of games
  static getTotalGames() {
    return ArcadeGame.totalGames;  // Return the total number of games created
  }
}

// Create instances of the ArcadeGame class
const game1 = new ArcadeGame("Space Invaders", 5000); // First game
const game2 = new ArcadeGame("Pac-Man", 7000);  // Second game

// Display game info
console.log(game1.getGameInfo()); // Output: Space Invaders: High Score = 5000
console.log(game2.getGameInfo()); // Output: Pac-Man: High Score = 7000

// Display total arcade games count
console.log(ArcadeGame.getTotalGames()); // Output: 2

```
