    "Jack and I decided on our level to be a prison escape. We want this level to be interactive and ask questions. When they interact with the other prisoners they will be given clues after answering questions correctly. After answering all the questions they will be able to solve the riddle/puzzle, and be able to successfully escape the prison. \n",
