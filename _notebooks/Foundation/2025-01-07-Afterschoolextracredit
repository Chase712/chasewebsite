    "Prior to CSSE I had absolutely no knowledge on coding, github, slack, and all these tools and skills that made up this class. I joined the class late, which was a struggle because I was behind everyone who had their tools setup and all the downloads. I felt very behind yet I was able to get a grasp. One of the two biggest life skills that I learned from this struggle was being able to follow instructions. It seemed like a very obvious skill everyone should know but it is very overlooked. For example, in the tool set up, you can't miss a step or all the other changes you made aren't gonna work. I had to carefully and deliberately go through the step-by-step process, which was surprisingly much more beneficial than I thought than going off on my own and just guessing on what I needed to do. The next life lesson that I had benefited from was communication. In this class as I worked together with my classes and methods peers, I gained valuable experience of working as a team. As a group we were able to collectively accomplish a teaching lesson that wouldn't have been possible without our communication. In my future career it is almost without a doubt that this is a skill that I would use throughout my whole life. Other than those life lessons, I have learned valuable tools in this class. To start off I learned how to use github. I didn’t realize the beneficial use of it until I really dived deep into it. On January 8th when I went after school to the presentation with the former CSSE students who are in college, I learned that one of the former students had benefited from knowing how to use github because his job needed it. I learned a good understanding of github and have used it to share, view, and apply code. A month ago, the Nvidia CEO was talking about their development and he had shared a code and said it was on GitHub, which prior to this class I would've had no idea what he was talking about. I learned about repositories, issues, and spotting problems with commits. Without github coding would feel nearly impossible to do. The other tool I learned was Slack. This Tool helped with my communication between my peers, TA’s, and teacher. I learned how to go through channels and send messages between people. Without this tool, I would've struggled with asking for help, sending code to my workmates, and finding all the assignments and instructions for this class. I would be disingenuous to say this class was easy sailing, but the struggles help me grow myself and me as a coding student and I feel proud of my work in this trimester of csse.\n"
